# SwishWeb Auth System

This Authentication System is a project assigned to me by my Information Security professor, Ergest. With a passion for innovation and a keen eye for security, I've been digging deep into the intricacies of web authentication. This project not only challenged my technical skills but also fueled my commitment to safeguarding digital identities. As the founder of SwishWeb, I approached this endeavor with unwavering dedication, aiming to create a robust system that not only meets industry standards but exceeds them. Through meticulous design and relentless testing, I strive to redefine the paradigm of authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure digital experience for all.
